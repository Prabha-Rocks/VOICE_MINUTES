Here’s a concise and user-friendly module-wise breakdown to explain your **Voice-to-Text Meeting Minutes Generator** project during a 30-minute interview:

---

### 🔰 Project Overview (2 mins)

* Goal: Automate meeting minutes generation from audio.
* Tools: Python, AWS (S3, Lambda, Transcribe), NLP (TextRank), Flask.
* Key Deliverables: Clean transcript + action-based summary + downloadable reports + dashboard.

---

### 🧩 Module 1: Audio Upload & S3 Integration (3 mins)

* ✅ Built a Python interface (or CLI) to upload `.mp3`/`.mp4` files.
* ✅ Uploaded audio stored in S3 bucket `audio_upload1`.
* ✅ Validates audio format and file naming (e.g., test\_audio.mp3).
* ✅ Stores metadata (filename, timestamp).
* ✅ Upload status shown to user via console or CLI.

🔧 AWS Used: S3
📁 Bucket Created: `audio_upload1`

---

### 🧩 Module 2: AWS Transcribe Setup (5 mins)

* ✅ Lambda automatically triggers AWS Transcribe when new audio is uploaded.
* ✅ Transcribe converts audio to text with speaker labels.
* ✅ Job monitored by Lambda and result stored in `transcribed_audio2` bucket.
* ✅ Output format: raw JSON transcript.

🪄 Services Used:

* Lambda (trigger)
* Amazon Transcribe
* S3 (`transcribed_audio2`)

---

### 🧩 Module 3: Transcript Post-Processing (5 mins)

* ✅ Input: Raw JSON transcript.
* ✅ Cleaned filler words (uh, um, like…).
* ✅ Formatted text into paragraphs and bullet points.
* ✅ Extracted speaker labels, timestamps if available.
* ✅ Output saved as both `.json` and `.txt`.

📁 Files:

* `clean_transcript.json`, `clean_transcript.txt`
* `cleaned_output1.json`, `cleaned_output1.txt` (for 2nd audio)

🧠 NLP Used: NLTK (for tokenizing, sentence segmentation)

---

### 🧩 Module 4: Meeting Summary Generation (6 mins)

* ✅ Used **TextRank** via `sumy` to extract key points.
* ✅ Generated:

  * Short Summary
  * Action items (if available)
  * Metadata (date, duration, speakers)
* ✅ Output saved as `.txt` (PDF optional, but skipped per project scope)

📁 Files:

* `meeting_summary.txt` ← from `test_audio.mp3`
* `summary_out1.txt` ← from `test1_audio.mp3`

🧠 NLP Used: Sumy (TextRank), datetime for metadata

---

### 🧩 Module 5: Dashboard & Downloadable Reports (7 mins)

* ✅ Built with Flask (single `app.py` file).
* ✅ Upload `.mp3` → Dashboard fetches matching `.txt` summary.
* ✅ Dynamically shows:

  * Summary
  * Action Items
  * Metadata
* ✅ Download options (TXT only).
* ✅ Works with multiple audios: test\_audio.mp3 → `meeting_summary.txt`, test1\_audio.mp3 → `summary_out1.txt`.

🌐 Tech Used: Flask, HTML templating
📁 Folder: `module5_dashboard/uploads`, links to `module4_summary_generation`

---

### 📦 Extra Features & Flexibility (2 mins)

* 📂 Modular code organization.
* 🔄 Can scale to add GPT-based summarization or Streamlit UI.
* 🔐 Dashboard can be enhanced with login (Flask-Login).
* ⛅ Future scope: CI/CD, S3 lifecycle rules, sentiment analysis.

---

### 💬 Final Wrap-Up (30 sec)

* This project automates the end-to-end pipeline: audio → transcript → clean text → summary → downloadable report → analytics.
* It mimics a real-world enterprise system built using cloud-native services and Python scripting.
